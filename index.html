  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p>
    Our team consists of a varied group of individuals with different background
    and skillset. We've got a mix of young talent, and experienced IT
    professionals, coming together to inspire and learn from each other. In 2020
    the Norwegian Intelligence Service hosted a CTF to attract cyber talents,
    and this group was formed following that event for those of us who wanted to
    continue solving challenges.
